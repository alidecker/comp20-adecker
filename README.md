# comp20-adecker

1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
- My assignments for the COMP 20 Web Development class at Tufts University.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
- I liked Assignment 2 because I enjoyed figuring out how to use the Google Maps API, and really started to understand what types of things go in which types of files (html, json, etc.) because I had to.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
- Coding finally doesn't feel daunting, and this is my 4th class (11, 15, ES 2). I think this is because I actually understand what's going on with the computer/Internet, and I understand the implications of doing or not doing certain things (e.g., security).

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
- How the web works.
    - Now I understand that asynchronous code is important so that stuff doesn't get frozen on the page.
    - Separation of concerns makes a lot more sense to me, now that I know that a web page depends on the communications between a web of files, databases, servers...that all do their particular purposes (hopefully) well and separately so that no one is confused.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
- Special UI effects so I can make professional-level UI/UX work.
